                 COEPD is committed to make BA Aspirants to get into their BA Dream Job. Initially we conduct BA workshop / Training and are followed by Nurturing Process. In the Nurturing Process, Participants 
                will be working on Case Studies, Scenarios, Diagrams, Documents and Tools. Our participants get Hands on experience through the Nurturing Process. Then guidance on Resume Preparation will be provided. 
                Now 3 levels of Mock Interviews will be conducted to ensure the Candidate speaks the same language which is there in the resume. Then the Resume is forwarded to the Placement Wing. Placement Wing HRs will 
                forward the resume to our COEPD Clients and other Open Market Clients and fetch Interviews for the Candidates. Candidates will prepare well for the interviews. Our Experiences say that our Student will get 
                an offer while attending 3 to 5 interviews. Some of our Students who is being selected to MNC are given below.
